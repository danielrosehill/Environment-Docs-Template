Please follow these rules when generating documentation about the environment:

## Timestamps

- When creating documentation about this environment, you should always ensure that timestamps are provided. 

Do this in two places:

- 1: Within file names
- 2: Within documents

## Formatting

Use two timestamp formats:

For filenames:

Suffix timestamps by suffixng them to a filename with a hyphen preceding them. E.g.: coderules_080725.md

For documents:

Use a format like this: 08-Aug-2025

The timestamp for documents can be in italics after the tittle.

# Documentation Scope Parameters

The purpose of the environment docs repo is to maintain documentation about the environment (ie, the environment of the host).

This is *NOT* the place to write documentation about specific projects even if they happen to be deployed on the host. For that, use the documentation folders within the project.
